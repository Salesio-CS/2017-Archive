# GenCon

It's a project on :rocket: **Salesio Programming Application 2017** :rocket: .

We produce an IoT thing that helps your daily scheduling. It's **"GenCon"**.
It'll read your schedule and remind things what you want when you're going to go outside.  When you're out, **"GenCon"** becomes scheduler on your smart phone. It's also accessible from your PC. It means, **"GenCon"** never leave from you. When your work has done and get back home, **"GenCon"** also back to your home entrance, and check your tomorrow tasks.
